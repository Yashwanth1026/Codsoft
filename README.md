# CodSoft Internship Tasks

This repository contains solutions to three tasks provided by CodSoft internship program. Below are the details of each task along with the approach used to solve them.

## Task 1: Movie Genre Prediction

### Problem Statement:
Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information.

### Approach:
For this task, we employed the following approach:
- Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess textual data.
- Converted text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Employed classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to train the model.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Task 2: Customer Churn Prediction

### Problem Statement:
Develop a model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business using historical customer data.

### Approach:
Our approach to solving this task included the following steps:
- Analyzed historical customer data, including features like usage behavior and customer demographics.
- Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- Employed algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting to build the churn prediction model.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Task 3: Spam SMS Detection

### Problem Statement:
Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

### Approach:
To tackle this task, we adopted the following strategy:
- Preprocessed the SMS data, including tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.
- Converted the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Employed classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to classify messages.
- Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
